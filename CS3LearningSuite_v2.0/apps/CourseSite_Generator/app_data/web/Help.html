        <p>Course Site Generator is a desktop Java application for creating and
            maintaining course websites. The app presents five main pages:Site, Syllabus, Meeting Times, 
            Office Hours, and Schedule. Within the site page, users can edit the details of their page and choose what information
            will be included in the website. Within the syllabus page, users can edit information pertaining to the syllabus
            of the course. Within the meeting times page, users can edit the times of lectures, recitations, and labs for a course.
            Within the Office Hours page, users can add, edit, and remove TAs for the course, as well as display their Office Hours.
            Within the schedule page, users can create, edit, and maintain the schedule for the duration of the course. 
            The application saves data to a JSON format that can
            be used by Web pages for displaying site data.
